# FightTheLandlord

## Introduce
An offline Android game of fight the landlord.
This android application is made for designing custom view and algorithm to let computer think like human.
I try my best to perfect the algorithm while computer choosing cards, but eventually it behaves not well because of that it't so hard to imitate human thinking to consider all situations while designing algorithm.
